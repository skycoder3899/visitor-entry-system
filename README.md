# Visitor-Entry-System

This system is usually used in places where a large number of visitors come and go. Whether we are running a huge corporate company or a small office, we will have to deal with visitors on a daily basis. This system records the visitor details and sends a notification to the employee host whom the visitor intends to visit for any specific purpose. Here, visitors on arrival will have to check-in. So they will register on visitors registration portal in which they will be required to fill up the necessary details. Visitor will be mailed with an e-pass and also, that e-pass will be required when he/she wants to check-out.


# Requirements-

We need an application, which can capture the name, email address, phone no., purpose of the visitor and
host department, host name needs to be captured for the host on the front end.
At the back end, once the user enters the information in the form, the backend should store all of the information with time stamp of the entry.
This should trigger an e-pass which will be mailed to the visitor and also, a notification email to the host informing him of the details of the visitor.
There should also be a provision for the visitor to check-out easily.
